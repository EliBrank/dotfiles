# dotfiles

This repo is structured around maintaining consistency and providing easy setup for common terminal-related configuration files.

A dotfiles directory within the main home directory is populated using the `bootstrap.sh` script, and symlinks are created within the appropriate subdirectories using GNU Stow.
